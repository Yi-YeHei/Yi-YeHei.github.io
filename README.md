## A Bad Saying

Last time I open github project is three years ago.At that time,I make a blog only for my campus card.I put a QR Code abot my blog on the campus card,what makes it very cool.
The github page's title is my old internet name:YiYeHei.Maybe I will change it in the past.
If I want to open my github page,I will go to the following website.
```
https://yi-yehei.github.io/
